== Description ==

The CareCAPTCHA is a WordPress plugin of the animal protection organization NOAH - Menschen für Tiere e.V. – developed on basis of Contact form 7.
It protects websites from spam and also draws attention to animal welfare. With this captcha, website operators appeal for more humanity in dealing with animals.
The motifs of the captcha show common everyday objects, which are still produced today by causing enormous cruelty to animals.
The message: Prevent animal cruelty with your humanity. On noah.de.

= Notation =

The captcha is kept simple and offers standardized security. If a higher security is desired, other captcha solutions should be preferred. The captcha is available in English and German.
